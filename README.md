<h3>Introduction</h3>  

---  

Here we present all necessary to reproduce the results of Key et al. 2021. For the analysis we use primarily (`snakemake`)[https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/] and (`python3`)[], with few bits of (`matlab`)[] and ('R')[] left. The pipeline is divided into four major analyses:
1. Within-patient
2. Across-patient
3. MGE analysis
4. Generation of Figures and Tables
  

Site is currently under construction.
